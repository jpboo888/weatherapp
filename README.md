# Weather App

This weather application shows you several different weather conditions under varios searches.  It was built so that when a user searches for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.  The user is also presented with the city name, the date, an icon representing the weather condition, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.  The user is also presented with a color representing whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.  This app presents a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.  And lastly, when you click on a city in the search history, the user is again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
